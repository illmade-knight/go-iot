We're developing an enrichment lib to be used in a microservice architecture - 
it is similar to the bigqueryservice I have here but its purpose is to consume a pubsub message, 
lookup up an identifier against a device cache (firestore, redis, whatever...) 
and enrich the original message with the cache data. 
The enriched data is then published to a messagetopic. 
Initially the enrichment is device focused but we should be able to enrich with any linked data eventually. 

The services lib files will reside in a package: enrichment and use import paths like the bigqquery service. 

here's our libs mod file

Lets start building the necessary lib files.

### prompt

I ask it to do less by itself and ask for clarification

### prompt

I give it clarification on my intent:

bqstore is a processor - 

we use these packages in microservice pipelines which we construct outside the lib we're developing here - 

these are the building blocks for full pipelines (good question by the way)
