That's an excellent observation, and you've perfectly described the natural evolution of this project. What you're proposing is not only a good idea but is considered a best practice for building maintainable and scalable Go applications.

Yes, you absolutely should structure this as a library that is consumed by one or more microservices.

Here’s a breakdown of how you can structure this, along with the key benefits:

### **Proposed Project Structure (Monorepo)**

The simplest and often most effective way to manage this is within a single Git repository (a monorepo) to avoid complex dependency versioning.

├── .github/          \# CI/CD workflows  
├── api/              \# .proto files for gRPC, OpenAPI specs, etc.  
├── cmd/              \# \--- EXECUTABLE MICROSERVICES \---  
│   ├── garden-monitor-bridge/  
│   │   └── main.go   \# Microservice for Garden Monitor data  
│   ├── device-control-bridge/

│  
├── internal/

└── go.sum

### **How It Works**

1. **The Library (/pkg/mqtt\_converter)**
    * This is the core, reusable code you've already built. It contains the IngestionService, the MessagePublisher and AttributeExtractor interfaces, and the GooglePubSubPublisher implementation.
    * It is completely generic. It knows *how* to connect MQTT to Pub/Sub but knows nothing about *what* data it's handling.
    * This package has its own unit tests to ensure its internal logic is sound.
2. **The Extractors (/pkg/extractors)**
    * This package contains the concrete implementations of your AttributeExtractor interface.
    * You can add new extractors here for new message types without ever touching the core mqtt\_converter library.
3. **The Microservices (/cmd/...)**
    * Each subdirectory in /cmd is a small, focused main package that compiles to a separate executable (a Docker image, a binary, etc.).
    * The main.go file in each microservice is responsible for the "wiring":
        * Loading configuration from environment variables or files.
        * Instantiating the correct AttributeExtractor from the extractors package.
        * Instantiating the GooglePubSubPublisher.
        * Creating and starting the IngestionService with the chosen components.
        * Handling signals for graceful shutdown.

**Example cmd/garden-monitor-bridge/main.go:**Go  
package main

import (  
"log"  
// ... other imports  
"your-repo/pkg/mqtt\_converter"  
"your-repo/pkg/extractors"  
)

func main() {  
// 1\. Load configuration (from env vars, etc.)  
cfg := loadAppConfig()

    // 2\. Create the specific extractor for this service  
    extractor := extractors.NewGardenMonitorExtractor()

    // 3\. Create the publisher  
    publisher := mqtt\_converter.NewGooglePubSubPublisher(...)

    // 4\. Create and run the service  
    service := mqtt\_converter.NewIngestionService(publisher, extractor, ...)  
    if err := service.Start(); err \!= nil {  
        log.Fatalf("Service failed to start: %v", err)  
    }  
    // ... handle graceful shutdown  
}

### **Key Advantages of This Model**

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** The core bridge logic is written, tested, and maintained in exactly one place.
* **Rapid Development:** Need a new MQTT-to-Pub/Sub bridge for a different message type? Just write a new extractor and a \~30-line main.go file. You get all the performance, reliability, and features of the core library for free.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
    * The **library** worries about the complex, generic task of bridging protocols.
    * The **microservice** worries about the specific business configuration and which components to use.
* **Simplified Deployments:** You build and deploy small, separate Docker images for each microservice. An update to the "garden monitor" extractor doesn't require you to redeploy the "device control" bridge.
* **Consistency:** All your bridges will have consistent logging, metrics, and shutdown behavior because they are all built on the same core.

You are definitely on the right track. Restructuring your project this way is the standard approach for building robust, reusable components in Go and is a hallmark of a mature software design.
